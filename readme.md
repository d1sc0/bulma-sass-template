## Styling

The UI has been thrown together using the bulma css framework and with Sass to allow for easy configuration. I'm using sass-cli locally to build/compile css files. Useful documentation on setting this up here -
https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-sass-cli/ (I've installed sass-cli via homebrew).

CLI command for css build

```
sass --no-source-map sass/sass-styles.scss:styles.css
```
